        <p class="details">After Graduation Plans: Right now I’m applying to Energy Engineering masters programs (yes, one of them is at Cornell), so fingers crossed that’s what I’ll be doing next year! But I’ll also be applying to internships and
          full-time positions in the meantime!</p>
        <p class="details">Best Memory from the Team: My favorite gymnastics memory is from my freshman year at Cornell. We were competing at ECACs, it was the last rotation and I was the last floor routine in our lineup. If I made my routine, we’d
          win and if I didn’t we’d be 2nd or 3rd. But of course I didn’t know that because none of my teammates would have told me before I went. All I remember is everyone cheering extra loud as I went for my last pass. When I landed it, the whole
          team erupted— screaming, fist pumping, all of it. During the last part of my dance I turn around and see my coach crying because he is so happy we won. Those 10s are my favorite memory, not because we won, but because in those moments I
          could feel how much trust my teammates put in me. To know that that many people believed in me is by far one of the most amazing feelings I’ve ever felt.</p>

        <p class="details">After Graduation Plans: Well first I will be going on birthright and taking an extended trip throughout Europe which I am super excited about!! Then I will be taking a gap year to work and then I will be attending law
          school! I have not finalized what exactly I will be doing during the gap year, but most likely something related to public health and/or sports administration.</p>
        <p class="details">Best Memory from the Team: At Ivy's my freshman year, I competed a new first pass (2.5 punch front), and not only did I nail that pass but I nailed my entire routine. It was in Bartels and the crowd was electric. I only
          seldom remember actually competing but I remember feeling super confident after that pass and then just having fun & showing off the rest of the routine w/ all my teammates clapping in & dancing along. And I remember afterwards when our
          choreographer said "look! see I knew it would pay off" and she was pointing to my score which was a PR, and ended up being the best on the team in floor and placing 2nd overall in the event at that meet! It was a really great feeling and
          helped my team win Ivy's that year. When we were awarded ind'v medals, I remember feeling really good when one of the other teams' coaches (who had stopped recruiting me) put it around my neck, and I had beaten all of her girls. THAT was a
          cherry on top. And jumping with joy and the chills we had when the announcer announced that our team had won. We all started hugging each other, the seniors were crying; it was incredible and a memory I'll cherish forever.</p>
