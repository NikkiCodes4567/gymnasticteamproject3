        this support system has helped me succeed and push myself
        to new academic heights.</q> </p>

    <q> Gymnastics gives me an outlet, to forget about everything else going on in your life. Whatever mood I’m in, whatever challenges I’ve faced through the day, I know I can put it all on hold and throw myself physically and
      mentally into the sport.</q>
